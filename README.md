## Project Status

## Features

- Browse a local Game Icons catalog with search.
- Compose layered icons with live visual feedback.
- Tweak style controls for foreground and background.
- Keep per-icon edit history in browser local storage.
- Work offline against local icon files.
- Sync/download icon assets when you decide to refresh local data.

## Tech Stack

- React 19
- TypeScript 5 (strict mode)

- Three.js
- Node.js scripts for icon sync/download tooling

## Quick Start

Requirements:

Install and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`.

## Commands

## Data and Assets

Aikon stores icon assets locally in `public/icons` and metadata in `public/icons.lock.json`.
