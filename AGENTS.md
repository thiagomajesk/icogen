## Workflow

- Never silently fill in ambiguous requirements
- Always prefer declarative over imperative code
- Prefer the simplest solution that could reasonably work
- Only change what was explicitly requested and nothing more
- Provide a brief execution plan before writing or changing code
- Define tests or success criteria before implementing non-trivial logic
- Start with a naive, obviously correct implementation before optimizing
- When stuck or uncertain, describe what is unclear and what was attempted
- Prefer smaller or incremental changes instead of big changes when refactoring code
- When the plans has conflicts, present options or trade-offs and wait for confirmation
- Before non-trivial work, if you have assumptions, ask for confirmation before proceeding
- When there is a contradiction or missing information, state the confusion and wait for resolution
- Push back on incorrect, risky, or poorly-scoped instructions and propose safer or simpler alternatives

## Tasks

- Commit using the conventional commits convention and make changes extra-explicit
- When working on features and fixes, split tasks so you can deliver gradual commits
- Remember to commit often, every commit should ensure a working-state of the project

## UI/UX & design guidelines

- **Produce world-class UI designs** with a focus on usability, aesthetics, and modern design principles
- Implement **subtle micro-interactions** (e.g., button hover effects, and smooth transitions)
- Ensure **clean typography, spacing, and layout balance** for a refined, premium look
- Focus on **delightful details** like hover effects, loading states, and smooth page transitions

## Skills

- Before starting any task, ensure you are always using the appropriate skill available
- If there's no skill available, you can search for one using https://skills.sh/ tooling
- Keep the skills in .agents/skills in sync to what is needed for this project at all times

## Documentation

- Keep a good descriptive README.md that is begginer-friendly
- When writting documentation, consider non-tech people as the main audience
